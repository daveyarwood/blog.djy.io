I [tried this once before][vignettes1] and it was pretty fun. I continue to find and use awesome things (the internet has many of them), so here are a few more things I've been enjoying lately.

I think having a [personal wiki][pwiki] is a great way to organize your life. It's like the digital equivalent of a handy scratchpad that you can use to jot down notes about anything that comes to your mind. (I use mine to keep track of fragments of melodies and lyrics that pop into my head, stupid band name ideas, programming project ideas, and all kinds of other things.) You can organize your ideas into separate files and link them to each other. Over time, you gradually build your own interconnected web of information that is useful to you.

[Vimwiki][vwiki] is a Vim plugin that lets you maintain a personal wiki in the form of a bunch of interlinked text files. Wiki pages can be written in Markdown or MediaWiki syntax, and the interface and keybindings are quite intuitive. Links can be made easily by highlighting text and pressing Enter, then opened by pressing Enter again.
