It's been a while since I've posted anything, so here's another laptop recording from the vault. It's a cover of one of the best Weezer B-sides, "Susanne." I recorded it in my dorm room during my last semester of college, Spring 2008. I was on a major Weezer binge at the time, although to be fair, I guess I never really stopped being on a major Weezer binge. Recording the backup vocals on this was especially fun. Anyway, enjoy.
