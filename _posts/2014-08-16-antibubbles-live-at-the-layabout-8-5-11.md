I was going through my computer and found this old Antibubbles live set -- thought I'd share it. It's from a fun house show we played at the Layabout in Durham on August 5, 2011.

The full, 8-song set is here if anyone wants it:

Tonight Tonight Tonight / Battle on the Mars / Our Capsule / Couple Skate / Red Blanket / You Gave Your Love to Me Softly (Weezer) / Flux / This Feeling

Antibubbles was a band from 2008-2013. I played guitar and sang. A bunch of other people were involved too at varying times, but our "all-star" line-up (2011-2013) was Seth Beard on drums, Anne Tomasevich on synth/vocals, and Joe Csurpek on bass/vocals. This recording is from our show at the Layabout in Durham, NC on 8/5/11.
