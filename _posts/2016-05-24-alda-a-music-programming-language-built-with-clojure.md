I gave this talk about [Alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda) a few months ago as part of [Clojure Remote](http://clojureremote.com/), the world's first remote-only Clojure conference.

This talk serves as a quick introduction to music programming languages and the philosophy that led me to create Alda. I talk a little bit about what Alda is and a few of the things you can do with it, but a large part of my talk focuses on why [Clojure](http://clojure.org) proved to be the perfect language for building something like Alda.

The conference was a blast - I was honored to be asked to give a talk, but even happier to attend and watch [all the other awesome talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPgnbBCmP6ZMfHPJ4yMwuoLEZvEe5LVe8)! I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of awesomeness Clojure Remote 2017 will bring.
