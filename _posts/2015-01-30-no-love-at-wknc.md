A couple weeks ago, WKNC invited my band [No Love](http://noloveraleigh.bandcamp.com) to play a set in their studio. Much fun was had.

In about a week (February 7) we'll be playing at the Lincoln Theater as part of the [Double Barrel Benefit](https://www.facebook.com/events/1674926522733928), an annual fundraiser for WKNC. WKNC told us that they get most of their funding just from this yearly show, so come check it out and help support local college radio!
