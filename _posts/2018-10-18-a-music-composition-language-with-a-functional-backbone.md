A couple months ago, I was fortunate enough to be invited to speak about
[Alda][alda] at the [Compose::Melbourne][compmelb] conference in Australia!
Compose is a conference all about functional programming as it pertains to
professionals, academics and hobbyists alike. The conference was great and I had
a fantastic time in Melbourne; I would go back in a heartbeat!

In my talk, I gave a lightning-fast introduction to Alda, and then I focused the
time I had left on giving a live demo of the types of compositional techniques I
use when I write music with Alda.
