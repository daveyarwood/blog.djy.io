Today marks my one-year anniversary of working at [Adzerk](http://adzerk.com), which also means I have now been working professionally as a software developer for one year. I could not be happier to be programming for a living, and I'm still not really over the fact that it was as easy as it was for me to break into a career that I had no prior work experience in, without a computer science degree.

Software development is a pretty unique industry in that respect, at least in the start-up world. It seems that most software start-ups are keenly aware of the fact that the best programmers are not necessarily the ones with start-up degrees or years of work experience developing software at some large corporation (although neither of these are bad things). It is important that you have a certain baseline of programming skills -- which can easily be learned by studying independently and working on hobby projects, like I did -- but the other main ingredient isn't education or experience, it's just having the right mindset.

I wrote a piece on the Adzerk tech blog, if you're curious to read more:
