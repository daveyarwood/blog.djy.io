# alda-clj lightning demo

As I mentioned in [my last blog post][minutiae2], I had the pleasure of
attending the [Heart of Clojure][heartofclojure] conference in Belgium this
month. Somebody suggested that I give a 5-minute lightning talk about
[Alda][alda], so I signed up at the last minute and (after some hasty
preparation) gave a quick demo of [alda-clj].

Because it was a Clojure conference, I decided to skim through the basics and
save time for some interesting examples of algorithmically generated music that
I created by writing Clojure code. Somehow, I managed to get through all of the
material in just about 5 minutes.

Here's the video:

# Musical forecast data

I'm continuing to develop [the talk I'll be giving at Strange Loop next
month][strangeloop], and I think it's coming along nicely. One focus of my talk
is what alda-clj can bring to the table that isn't possible with embedded
Clojure code in an Alda score.

To demonstrate this, I came up with a fun example Clojure program that pulls
weather forecast data from the [National Weather Service API][nwsapi] and uses
it to generate a musical score. The generated score consists of several
instrument parts, each one representing the weather forecast for a different
city, and the notes' pitch, duration, volume, and panning are influenced by the
temperature, wind speed and wind direction during a one-hour period in that
city.

As usual, writing a program like this in Clojure, one that fetches data from
some API and transforms it into a desired result, was dead simple. It's exactly
the sort of task at which Clojure excels.

I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use the National Weather
Service API. No API key is required (although the documentation does state that
there will be API keys at some point in the future), and the API is based upon
[JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data)][json-ld], which makes it easy to discover
related data via embedded links in the response body. I would recommend the
National Weather Service API to anyone who's looking for a data source for
educational or testing purposes or as an input for generative art.

# Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

There's this really great book by Bruce Tate called [_Seven Languages in Seven
Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages_][7li7w]. I read it
not too long after it came out in 2012, and I found it very inspiring and
enjoyable. I've been re-reading it recently for no particular reason and seven
years later (aeons in the world of software), it still holds up!

The book walks you through the condensed version of learning each language from
scratch, providing engaging summaries about what makes the language unique,
easy-to-follow code examples, and rigorous self-study exercises at the end of
each chapter. The languages covered are Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang,
Clojure, and Haskell.

(By the way, Tate released a sequel in 2014, [_Seven More Languages in Seven
Weeks: Languages That Are Shaping the Future_][7mli7w], which I also quickly
devoured. The second round of languages consisted of Lua, Factor, Elixir, Elm,
Julia, miniKanren, and Idris. It's also well worth reading!)
