Today marks my one-year anniversary of working at [Adzerk][kevel], which also
means I have now been working professionally as a software developer for one
year. I could not be happier to be programming for a living, and I'm still not
really over the fact that it was as easy as it was for me to break into a career
that I had no prior work experience in, without a computer science degree.

Software development is a pretty unique industry in that respect, at least in
the start-up world. It seems that most software start-ups are keenly aware of
the fact that the best programmers are not necessarily the ones with CS degrees
or years of work experience developing software at some large corporation
(although neither of these are necessarily bad things). It is important that you
have a certain baseline of programming skills -- which can be learned by
studying independently and working on hobby projects, like I did -- but the
other main ingredient isn't education or experience, it's just having the right
mindset.

I wrote a piece on the Adzerk tech blog, if you're curious to read more:
