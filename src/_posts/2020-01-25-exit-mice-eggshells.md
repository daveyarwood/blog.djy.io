My band, [Exit Mice][exit-mice], released our second EP this past month. It's
called _Eggshells_ and we're very excited about it! You can listen to it on all
the major streaming services (Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, etc.), or right here:

Just like with [our first EP][exit-mice-first-ep-post], we recorded the raw
tracks in Ross's basement where we practice, and our friend Duncan (of [Hammer
No More the Fingers][hnmtf] and [Beauty World][beauty-world] fame) did a superb
job of mixing them and helping us find the sounds we were searching for.

When we recorded our first EP, we were still a three-piece. Shortly before we
played our first show, Eric Lee joined the band to play synthesizer and second
guitar. I had taken a stab at recording a few synthesizer parts myself on our
first EP, but I think Eric really takes the synthesizer element of Exit Mice to
another level. He knows a lot more than I do when it comes to getting great
sounds out of a synthesizer, and I think it really shows on _Eggshells_.
