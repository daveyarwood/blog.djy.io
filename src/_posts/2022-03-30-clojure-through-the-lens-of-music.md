Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking at [Functional Conf][fn-conf], a
functional programming conference that usually takes place in India, but was all
virtual this year due to the pandemic. I had a great time!

Here is the video of my talk, which was about how we can better understand the
functions in the Clojure standard library by "visualizing" them with music
(naturally, using [Alda][alda] and its Clojure library, [alda-clj]):

By the way, there were 2 other Clojure-centric talks in the conference, and they were both
great, so check them out, too!
