I've started a new band called **Trash Signal**, and I'm excited to announce
that our first single, "The Palms", is available now on all of the major
streaming services (Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, etc.). Look for it wherever you
listen to music!

You can also listen to it right here:

This band came to fruition by accident when I went to an outdoor karaoke event
in Durham and a friend introduced me to Lishie Comiskey. We started talking and
realized that we share a lot of musical interests, including an adoration of the
band [Lost Sounds][lost-sounds]. One of us said "Let's start a band that sounds
like Lost Sounds!" and the rest is history.

At the moment, Trash Signal is me (guitar, synthesizer, drum programming) and
Lishie (bass, vocals, lyrics), and we're planning to expand and turn it into
more of a live thing once we find the right people. We have a bunch of other
songs in the works and we're excited about it!
