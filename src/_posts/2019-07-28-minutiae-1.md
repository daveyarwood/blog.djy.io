I've been meaning to update this blog more often for a long time now. The
problem I have is that I have a lot of interesting things that I could write
about, but I feel like it would take so much effort to produce a blog post worth
reading, I just never have the time to do it. As a result, I've been setting
aside time only about once every 2 to 6 months to write a long blog post about a
particular topic.

I've been thinking lately that it might be interesting to explore writing
smaller, more frequent posts about various things I've been spending time on or
that have captured my interest lately. [Alex Miller][alexmiller] and [Bozhidar
Batsov][bozhidarbatsov] have been doing this sort of journaling recently and I
really enjoy reading it, so I figured I'd take a stab at it too.

Here we go!

# Strange Loop

I'm thrilled to be [speaking at Strange Loop][strangeloop] in September! I'll be
talking about a handful of interesting directions that I've taken [Alda][alda]
over the last 7 years, and in particular, Alda's evolving relationship with
Clojure.

# Alda v2

Since December, I've been gradually rewriting Alda from the ground up. It's a
huge undertaking, but something I've been wanting to do for a very long time.
I'll be talking about this in more depth in [my talk at Strange
Loop][strangeloop], but just as a teaser, the next version of Alda will feature:

* A simpler architecture that does more work on the client side.
* A native executable client written in Go.
* Support for [live coding][live-coding].

If you're interested in following my progress, you can watch the [Alda v2
project on GitHub][alda-v2-project] or say hello in the #development channel in
the [Alda Slack group][alda-slack].

# alda4j

I recently hacked together something interesting to help someone build a game
for a competition. I call it [alda4j].

Alda4j is for the niche use case where you want to embed Alda into your Java
application. It leverages the [Clojure Java API][clojure-java-api] to invoke the
Clojure code being run on the Alda background worker process, but in the
foreground in your application.

Here is some [example Java code][alda4j-example] that uses Alda4j to play lines
of Alda code that are input by the user.

# Vim Clojure tooling and the prepl

It's always been interesting to be a Vim user in the Clojure community. By and
large, Clojure programmers tend to use either Emacs or Cursive. The [2019 State
of Clojure survey results][2019-soc-results] show 46% of respondents using
Emacs, 30% using Cursive, and a scant **10%** using Vim as a primary Clojure
development environment.

## Fireplace

[Fireplace][fireplace] has been the standard Vim plugin for Clojure development
for quite a long time, and it's still the one that I would recommend to people
who are just getting started with using Vim tooling for Clojure. The main
reasons that I would recommend it are that it's been around for the longest, and
it's the one that I would guess most Clojurist Vimmers use today, so if you run
into any problems, chances are you'll be able to find someone who can help.

I've never had any major problems with Fireplace, but I've noticed more and more
Vim plugins doing their work asynchronously, which is super awesome because it
makes the overall Vim experience feel fast and lightweight. As of the last time
I used Fireplace, it was handling code evaluation synchronously, meaning that
every time I evaluated a Clojure expression, I would have to wait however many
milliseconds it took for the result to come back before I could do anything else
in Vim. That might not sound terrible, but when you live in your text editor
like I do, being able to speed up things like this is a major quality-of-life
improvement!

## Acid, vim-iced

Not long ago, I started seeing alternative Clojure plugins for Vim begin to
spring up, some of which advertised that they were doing things asynchronously,
which piqued my interest. Two plugins worth exploring in this arena are
[acid][acid] and [vim-iced][iced]. Both acid and vim-iced operate by
communicating with an nREPL server that you start within the context of your
project.

## Conjure

More recently, there is a new plugin called [Conjure][conjure] that provides
Clojure tooling by using a [prepl] connection instead of an nREPL connection.
The prepl itself is a new tool that has only been a part of Clojure since
version 1.10, which was released in December 2018. The prepl is conceptually
simpler than the nREPL, and it is designed for programmatic use by things like
editor plugins. Conjure provides a really excellent development experience out
of the box, and it's obvious that a lot of thought has gone into the user
experience, which I appreciate. I've had a handful of conversations with the
author and he's been very responsive and considerate. The plugin continues to
improve week by week and it's a joy to use.

# No comment

You may have noticed that I've quietly removed the comments section of this
blog. For the most part, my blog posts don't really get any comments via the
Disqus widget. If people comment on or discuss my writing at all, it mostly
tends to happen on Reddit and Hacker News, where I'm in the habit of posting my
lengthier blog posts.

I probably won't post smaller posts like this one on Reddit and Hacker News, but
I will at least mention them on Twitter, and hopefully I'll remember to post a
link to the Twitter thread on the blog post for comments. If I forget to do
that, you can always just [tweet in my general direction][twitter]!
