This past September, while I was attending [Strange Loop][strange-loop] in St.
Louis, I had the pleasure of being interviewed by Jordan Miller (who has a
podcast called [_Lost in Lambduhhs_][lostinlambduhhs]) for a podcast series by
[JUXT][juxt] and [Vouch][vouch] where they interviewed Strange Loop attendees to
"learn about their interests, ongoing projects, and innovative ideas."

It was a lovely 15-minute chat. We talked about [Alda][alda] and the
relationship between programming and music, and Jordan caught me off-guard with
a brilliant question: what is the programming equivalent of being able to solo
over [_Giant Steps_][giant-steps]? Listen to the interview for the answer! :)
