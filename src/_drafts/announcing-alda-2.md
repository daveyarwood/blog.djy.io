I'm excited to announce the release of Alda 2.0.0. This new version of Alda is a
from-the-ground-up rewrite that I've been working on for more than 2 years, and
I couldn't be happier to finally share it with everyone!

# Notes

* Explain the rewrite.
  * Why the rewrite? Link to my previous post about that, but give a short
    summary.

* What's new?

* What's changed?
  * Link to migration guide in docs.

* Try it out
  * Instructions for upgrading
  * New users: alda.io/install
  * Existing users: `alda update` (twice)
    * This might be awkward enough to explain that I should just tell everyone
      to go to alda.io/install.

I hope you enjoy this next generation of Alda, and that you're as excited about
the future of Alda as I am. If you'd like, you can join our [Slack
group][alda-slack] and let us know what you think of Alda v2. I'd love to hear
your thoughts!

Finally, I should mention that if you enjoy my work on Alda, you can choose to
support me and sustain the ongoing development of Alda by [becoming a
sponsor][gh-sponsor].

Have fun!
