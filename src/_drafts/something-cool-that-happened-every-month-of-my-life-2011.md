5 years ago, I was doing some reminiscing about what my life had been like 5
years prior to _that_ (in 2010), and I had a lot of fun [sharing those
memories][something-cool-2010].

It's been a long time since I posted those memories from 2010, but I've been
thinking about it recently and now I'd like to continue the timeline by sharing
some memories from 2011. I hope you enjoy them!

**January 2011:** [Antibubbles][antibubbles] had the pleasure of opening for
[Anamanaguchi][anamanaguchi] when their tour came through Durham. I had noticed
on [the Pinhook][the-pinhook]'s website that Anamanaguchi were scheduled to play
there, and there was no opening act listed, so I took a chance and sent the
venue an email, asking if perhaps my band could be added to the bill as an
opener. I was pleasantly surprised when it worked out!

The night was magical. The Pinhook was packed from wall to wall with people who
were there to see Anamanaguchi (and they ended up being an enthusiastic audience
for Antibubbles, too!). When Anamanaguchi took the stage, it looked like
literally everybody in the room was dancing. I felt star-struck that my band had
the opportunity to share a bill with a band of their calibre. They were also
super down-to-earth and they chatted with us for a while after the show. Their
drummer even bought an Antibubbles LP!

**February 2011:** [Renay][rad] and I collaborated on a modern dance piece that
we performed at [Motorco][motorco] in Durham. Being held close to Valentine's
Day, the show was a collection of performances by various artists (dancers,
spoken word performers, martial artists, etc.) centered around the theme of
love.

Our piece was called _Fragaria_, named after the scientific name for the
[strawberry plant][fragaria-plant]. We distributed home-made chocolate-covered
strawberries to the audience, and Renay and I performed a live collaboration
where she improvised modern dance movements and I improvised a looped soundscape
by playing an electric bass through effect pedals.

I still look back fondly on that performance. It's one of only a couple of
collaborations that Renay and I have done where I've performed the music in a
live setting to accompany her dance.

**March 2011:** ...

* march 2011
  * on the weekend of my 25th birthday, devour played some shows out of town -
    charlotte, atlanta, athens. the athens show in particular was a blast. the
    plush palace, throwing beanie babies back and forth, crowd surfed in a tiny
    living room while bukkake boys played
  * excerpt from an email to my mom: "we were crammed into a tiny living room
    where as we played, the crowd fought with Beanie Babies, Silly String and a
    small plastic wiffle ball bat"
  * i also ended up accidentally leaving my bass behind in that basement and the
    basement flooded, but i did eventually manage to get my bass back to raleigh
    through a network of friends-of-friends, and despite having survived a
    flood, my bass amazingly still played just fine!
