5 years ago, I was doing some reminiscing about what my life had been like 5
years prior to _that_ (in 2010), and I had a lot of fun [sharing those
memories][something-cool-2010].

It's been a long time since I posted those memories from 2010, but I've been
thinking about it recently and now I'd like to continue the timeline by sharing
some memories from 2011. I hope you enjoy them!

**January 2011:** ...

Antibubbles had the pleasure of opening for [Anamanaguchi][anamanaguchi] when
their tour came through Durham. I had noticed that ...

* january 2011
  * antibubbles at pinhook 1/12 with anamanaguchi! the first time we ever played
    with them, although we played with them again at least 1 more time after
    that. i'd sent the pinhook an email the previous month asking if we could
    open the show, and was pleasantly surprised that it worked out. the night
    was magical. the pinhook was packed wall to wall with people, and it looked
    like literally everybody in the room was dancing when anamanaguchi played. i
    was star-struck that we got an opportunity to play with anamanaguchi.

**March 2011:** ...

* march 2011
  * on the weekend of my 25th birthday, devour played some shows out of town -
    charlotte, atlanta, athens. the athens show in particular was a blast. the
    plush palace, throwing beanie babies back and forth, crowd surfed in a tiny
    living room while bukkake boys played
  * excerpt from an email to my mom: "we were crammed into a tiny living room
    where as we played, the crowd fought with Beanie Babies, Silly String and a
    small plastic wiffle ball bat"
  * i also ended up accidentally leaving my bass behind in that basement and the
    basement flooded, but i did eventually manage to get my bass back to raleigh
    through a network of friends-of-friends, and despite having survived a
    flood, my bass amazingly still played just fine!
