5 years ago, I was doing some reminiscing about what my life had been like 5
years prior to _that_ (in 2010), and I had a lot of fun [sharing those
memories][something-cool-2010].

It's been a long time since I posted those memories from 2010, but I've been
thinking about it recently and now I'd like to continue the timeline by sharing
some memories from 2011. I hope you enjoy them!

**January 2011:** [Antibubbles][antibubbles] had the pleasure of opening for
[Anamanaguchi][anamanaguchi] when their tour came through Durham. I had noticed
on [the Pinhook][the-pinhook]'s website that Anamanaguchi were scheduled to play
there, and there was no opening act listed, so I took a chance and sent the
venue an email, asking if perhaps my band could be added to the bill as an
opener. I was pleasantly surprised when it worked out!

The night was magical. The Pinhook was packed from wall to wall with people who
were there to see Anamanaguchi (and they ended up being an enthusiastic audience
for Antibubbles, too!). When Anamanaguchi took the stage, it looked like
literally everybody in the room was dancing. I felt star-struck that my band had
the opportunity to share a bill with a band of their calibre. They were also
super down-to-earth and they chatted with us for a while after the show. Their
drummer even bought an Antibubbles LP!

**February 2011:** [Renay][rad] and I collaborated on a modern dance piece that
we performed at [Motorco][motorco] in Durham. Being held close to Valentine's
Day, the show was a collection of performances by various artists (dancers,
spoken word performers, martial artists, etc.) centered around the theme of
love.

Our piece was called _Fragaria_, named after the scientific name for the
[strawberry plant][fragaria-plant]. We distributed home-made chocolate-covered
strawberries to the audience, and Renay and I performed a live collaboration
where she improvised modern dance movements and I improvised a looped soundscape
by playing an electric bass through effect pedals.

I still look back fondly on that performance. It's one of only a couple of
collaborations that Renay and I have done where I've performed the music in a
live setting to accompany her dance.

> TODO: image of me crowd surfing in the plush palace

**March 2011:** On the weekend of my 25th birthday, [Devour][devour] played some
shows out of town in Charlotte, Atlanta and Athens. The Athens show, in
particular, was a blast! We played at a house called the Plush Palace. I found
an email where I described it to my mom like this: "We were crammed into a tiny
living room where, as we played, the crowd fought with Beanie Babies, Silly
String and a small plastic wiffle ball bat." I remember taking any opportunity
when I wasn't playing to pick up Beanie Babies and throw them back at the crowd.
I also remember crowd surfing (above) in this tiny living room while the
[Bukkake Boys][bukkake-boys] played their set. The whole thing was delightfully
chaotic.

I an impressive display of bad luck, I somehow ended up accidentally leaving my
bass behind in the basement of that house in Athens, and then there was a big
rain storm and the basement was flooded! I did eventually manage to get my bass
back to Raleigh through a network of friends-of-friends, and despite having
_survived a flood_, my bass amazingly still played just fine!

</center>

**April 2011:** This was the month that Antibubbles released our [Planet
Xanax][planet-xanax] 7". On April 1, we got to play a show at the [Local
506][local-506] with [Royal Bangs][royal-bangs], who were (and are!) amazing.
Because it was April Fools' Day, we couldn't resist the temptation to do
something silly during our set. So, we learned the first minute of the Kansas
classic "Carry on My Wayward Son" and pretended we were playing it as a cover,
with the introductory 3-part vocal harmony and everything. At the point in the
song where I would have sung the first verse, I said "April Fools!" and we
launched into one of our songs instead.

As an aside, it looks like Royal Bangs had [just played on David
Letterman][royal-bangs-letterman], maybe even the same day as they played with
us in Chapel Hill!? I suppose it's possible that they filmed their performance
on Letterman early that morning and then drove straight to North Carolina,
although that seems unlikely because it's about an 8 hour drive if there's no
traffic and you don't stop. Or perhaps they flew down and borrowed gear? Or
maybe their performance on Letterman was filmed a day or two prior, and it was
just aired the same day as the show. I have a vague memory from after our show
at the Local 506 was over, of the Royal Bangs asking the bartender to turn the
TV on, and perhaps it was so that they could watch themselves performing live on
David Letterman!

> TODO: photo of us playing our set

**May 2011:** Antibubbles were invited to play a set at an outdoor [Free Comic
Book Day][free-comic-book-day] event at [Ultimate Comics][ultimate-comics] in
Chapel Hill. It was among the most memorable shows that we ever played. Just for
fun, we all decided to wear matching outfits with sunglasses, [jorts][jorts] and
T-shirts cut into tank tops. I got super sun-burned, but all in all it was a lot
of fun.

> TODO: photo of us playing with kittens

**June 2011:** Antibubbles visited the [Goathouse Refuge][goathouse-refuge], an
animal sanctuary dedicated to rescuing and finding adoptive homes for cats. They
had a _lot_ of cats there. We went there collectively as a band because we had
this crazy idea to shoot a music video for ["Tonight Tonight
Tonight"][antibubbles-ttt] there, interspersing footage of us playing with
kittens, etc. with footage of us playing the song live.

Sadly, we never ended up shooting the video, but it was still fun to visit the
Goathouse Refuge and hang out in a room full of cuddly kittens for a while.

> TODO: picture of the house

**July 2011:** I think this was the month when Renay and I closed on our first
house in Durham. It was a nice little 1961 ranch house with more than its fair
share of things needing to be fixed, as a result of the previous owner's
questionable DIY decisions... Maintenance headaches aside, I look back fondly on
living in that house with Renay, our cat, Steve, and our greyhound, Barbara. We
lived in that house until 2016, when we moved to Hillsborough to be closer to
where Renay works.

</div>

**August 2011:** Antibubbles played a really fun house show at a place called
the Layabout, with the bands [Bridget and the Squares][bridget], [White
Laces][white-laces], and [Grandfather][grandfather]. We decided to troll our
keyboard player, Anne, by secretly shoe-horning the riff from "Enter Sandman" by
Metallica into the break in the middle of our song ["Red Blanket"][red-blanket].
It was hilarious. (Sorry, Anne!)
