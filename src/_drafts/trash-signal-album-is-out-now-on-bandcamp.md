Happy new year! üéá

I'm happy to announce that my synth punk band Trash Signal's album is out now on
[our Bandcamp][trash-signal-album-bandcamp]. We're super proud of this album.
You can listen to the whole thing for free, and if you'd like to support us, you
can also pay to download the 8 song album. We worked hard on this, and your
support would be very much appreciated! üôè
