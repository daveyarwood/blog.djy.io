# There seems to be some kind of bug where if I do this:
#
# * Create a new draft, work on it for a while, don't publish it yet.
# * Create ANOTHER new draft, start working on it.
#
# The index page never seems to update; it always just shows the first draft,
# and not the second.
#
# Blowing away _site fixes it. So we'll just always do that.

# This initial build without --incremental seems to be necessary in order to
# pick up on new files added since the last time you ran `serve --incremental`.
# I don't fully understand this, but this way, at least I can ^C and re-run a
# single script and pick up on those changes.
bundle exec jekyll build "$@" || exit 1

# Serve locally and rebuild incrementally whenever files change. Adding or
# renaming files won't be picked up; that requires interrupting and re-running
# this script.
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental "$@"
