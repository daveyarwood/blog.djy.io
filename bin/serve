# pick up on new files added since the last time you ran `serve --incremental`.
# I don't fully understand this, but this way, at least I can ^C and re-run a
# single script and pick up on those changes.

# Serve locally and rebuild incrementally whenever files change. Adding or
# renaming files won't be picked up; that requires interrupting and re-running
# this script.
